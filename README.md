## Instructions
1. Open an IDE of your choice (e.g. Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, ...)
2. Run an algorithm of your choice. The results can be found in the ```output``` folder. The possible filenames are:
- uniform_cost_search.py
- gbfs.py
- astar.py
3. To obtain the analysis of the algorithms on the 50 puzzles, run the following file:
- analyze.py
4. Run the following file to obtain the results of A* with Manhattan heuristic on the scaled puzzles:
- astar_scaled.py

## Input Files
1. ```input.txt``` contains the original 3 puzzles
2. ```50_puzzles.txt``` contains the 50 puzzles, generated by ```puzzle_generator```
3. ```scaled_puzzles.txt``` contains the scaled puzzles, generated by ```scaled_puzzle_generator.py```

## Output Files
1. ```output``` contains the output of the algorithms on the original 3 puzzles.
2. ```output50``` contains the output of the algorithms on 50 puzzles.
3. ```output_scaled``` contains the output of A* with Manhattan heuristic on the scaled puzzles.
